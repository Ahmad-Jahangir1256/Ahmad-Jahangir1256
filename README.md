## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ahmad an enthusiastic computer science student.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on exploring various fields of coding, including web development, algorithms, and data structures.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced concepts in computer science, web design, and user experience (UI/UX). I am also delving into front-end and back-end development.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects or personal projects involving web development, coding challenges, or even game development.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving my full-stack development skills, learning more about databases, and working on real-world applications.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about coding in languages like Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS; web design principles; or even chess strategies â€” I enjoy discussing these topics!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-jahangir-380472329/) or reach out to me via email at (Ahmad.Jahangir.1256@gmail.com). Feel free to message me if you have any interesting project ideas or want to collaborate.
- âš¡ Fun fact: When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll likely find me playing a game of chess. I love the challenge of strategic thinking and problem-solving, which also reflects in my coding and web design work!

I am passionate about learning and growing in the field of computer science, and Iâ€™m always open to new ideas and challenges. If you have a project, an idea, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
